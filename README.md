# ultimate_chat_bot

Hello , 
this is a web server which exposes an AI API  , which helps us for our bot chat application. 

Based on the message put by the user . The API gets all intents which might be possible the user is havning to talk to. 
Based on the relevant intent and maximum confidence we send a reply to the user.

This project is built using [nodejs][https://nodejs.org/en/docs/] , [Typescript][https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html]
For DB : Mongoose for MongoDB.

To start project on your machine . I have provided the .env file which will be chosen by defult and help you with all configurations.

Install nodejs on your machine and navigate to the folder and run : **npm start** . This will start the server at port : 3000 and your API is ready to take the messages.
